I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Chicago, advised by [Victor Veitch](http://victorveitch.com/){:target="_blank"}.
My research is about understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) reach decisions, and how this informs agentic safety evaluations for e.g. deception or collusion; hence my research lies at the intersection of causality, interpretability, and game theory.

Here is my [CV](http://davidpreber.github.io/files/Reber_CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}
